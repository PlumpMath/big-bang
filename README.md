# Big-Bang [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rm-hull/big-bang.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rm-hull/big-bang)

ClojureScript game loop, loosely based on Racket's [big-bang][a] and implemented on top of _core.async_.
It is a pure ClojureScript implementation with no external Javascript dependencies. Using Big-Bang encourages
you to implement what would be otherwise stateful code in a pure functional manner; of course, inevitably,
at some point you have to punch outside and twiddle some IO or paint some pixels.

See http://rm-hull.github.io/big-bang/example.html for some in-progress demos, and a face-off<sup>*</sup>
between Big-Bang and [OM](https://github.com/swannodette/om) here:

<sup>*</sup> - tongue-in-cheek, of course. ãƒ„

### Pre-requisites

You will need [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 2.3.4 or
above installed.

### Building & Testing

To build and install the library locally, run:

    $ lein cljsbuild once
    $ lein install

To test against [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), ensure that that
package is installed properly, and run:

    $ lein cljsbuild test

Alternatively, open ```resources/run-tests.html``` in a browser - this
executes the tests and the test results are displayed on the page.

### Including in your project

There _will be_ an 'alpha-quality' version hosted at [Clojars](https://clojars.org/rm-hull/big-bang) at some point soon.
For leiningen include a dependency:

```clojure
[rm-hull/big-bang "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"]
```

For maven-based projects, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>rm-hull</groupId>
  <artifactId>big-bang</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
## Basic Usage

### Event Handling and ```IChannelSource```

The ```big-bang.event-handler``` namespace provides a function that installs
event-listeners onto DOM elements, and rather than implementing a callback
architecture, the handler instead returns a reified ```IChannelSource``` object;
this exposes a channel onto which events are placed and a facility to de-install
the event listener.

```clojure
(def listener (add-event-listener (.-body js/document) :click))

(go
  (loop []
    (when-let [e (<! (data-channel listener))]
      (.log js/console (str "Received: " x))
      (recur)))))

(go
  (<! (timeout 20000))
  (shutdown! listener))
```

Multiple event listeners are used internally to drive state transitions
in the ```big-bang!``` game loop on key presses, mouse events, etc.

### Regular Ticking

The ```big-bang.timer``` namespace provides a mechanism that wraps the
javascript ```setInterval``` callback, sending a predetermined payload
on a channel at regular intervals:

```clojure
(def ticker (interval-ticker 100))              ; [1]

(go
  (loop []
    (when-let [x (<! (data-channel ticker))]    ; [2]
      (.log js/console (str "Received: " x ))
      (recur))))

(go
  (<! (timeout 2000)) ; pause for a short time  ; [3]
  (shutdown! ticker))                           ; [4]
```

Notice the similarity to the prior event listener example above.

At [1], a ticker is created and started; note that, while there is no consumer
taking events from the timer channel, messages are dropped in order to prevent
a backlog. Similarly if the consumer loop cannot keep up with the rate that
the ticker is producing, then events will similarly be dropped.

At [2], inside a go block, a value is consumed from the ticker's timer channel.
If a ```nil``` value is returned from the channel, it can be assumed that the
ticker has elsewhere been stopped, and the loop can be terminated. Step [3] then
incurs a 2 second delay before stopping the ticker at step [4].

The ticker is used internally to drive state transitions in the ```big-bang!```
game loop.

## Differences from the Racket implementation

## TODO

* ~~Variable ```:on-tick``` rate & re-org. recur/loop with animation-frame~~
* Implement ```:target-id``` element for event handlers to attach to (default to _document_)
* Implement ```:on-key``` and ```:on-release``` (maps to _keydown_ and _keyup_ events respectively)
* implement ```:on-mouse```, add a ```(mouse-handler ...)``` like Racket's ```(pad-handler ...)```
* Implement ```:on-touch``` with ```(touch-handler ...)```
* Deregister event listeners on stop
* ~~Return list of states on stop if ```:record?``` is true, else ```nil```~~
* Playback states functionality via ```:playback```
* External messages via ```:on-receive``` with ```:receive-channel``` & ```:send-channel```
* ~~```(make-package w m)```, ```(package? x)```, extraction functions~~
* Tests, documentation, examples

## Known Bugs

* ~~```lein cljsbuild test``` does not appear to be working properly, returns _"Could not locate test command."_~~
